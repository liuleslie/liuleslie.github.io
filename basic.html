          <p class="warning">⚠︎ Text contains flashing images.</p>
          <p>Drawing from my interests in aesthetics and online culture, Basic Space is a small fictional festival exploring the design of meme formats to ask, <em>how do information and content relate to their container? Diagrammatic things carry a natural importance and legitimacy — what happens when we empty memes, media that often is already so distilled to its most essential ideas?</em></p>
          <p>This project emerged from an exercise to program a generative pattern maker. Pulling from four popular meme formats — the political compass, Advice Animals, Is This A Pigeon, and Loss — I began with a dense, quiltlike texture, which ultimately makes up the background of the event’s posters.</p>
          <img style="width: 100%;" src="basic/sources.png" alt="An annotated screenshot of an abstract texture in light brown and black. The annotations are in red, with four regions of the texture marked out, their source memes shown to to the side.">

          <p>After experimenting with the tool at different scales and color settings, I landed on a final pattern, which I then riso-printed.</p>

          <p>The festival’s promotional materials come with a microsite prototyped in p5.js. As a metaphor for the anatomy of memes, mouse interactions reveal the outlines of the festival’s name — the bubbling circle changing color as the visitor hovers over the four quadrants, referencing the political compass. By using widely available typefaces, these assets emphasize the content-driven nature of memes as a communicative medium.</p>
