                    <p>I’ve been fascinated with Americana, more specifically TV dinners. The American TV dinner tells a tale of midcentury innovation and shifting dynamics within both the household and the population’s relationship with technology.</p>
                    <img src="https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/4556592/original_181cd7f55d4caae5a72e127f632ce20a.jpg?1562094474?bc=1" alt="photograph of a TV dinner placed on a stovetop, with a few brown grocery bags on the countertop next to a towel.">
                    <span class="caption">Stephen Shore, <em>New York, New York, September-October 1972</em>.</span><br>
                    <p>Between a survey and conversations with people about their experiences with frozen food, I appreciated not only how personal food practices can be, but also the sheer range of socioeconomic topics the TV dinner can address. Some folks, reminded of military rations, were interested in its compact form, while others wondered about the connections between prepackaged food and wellness/diet culture in contemporary America. With such a rich subject one of my main challenges soon became, <em>how might I present takes on the TV dinner — an undeniably retro cultural artifact — in a way that feels native to digital interaction?</em></p>
                    <p>I knew that I wanted to make something generative and introspective. What initially drew me to TV dinners was how spectacular their promise of homecooked goodness — albeit prepared by faceless yet familiar corporations — was, and how expectations and reality seldom seemed to match up. It was this kind of awkward, uncomfortable feeling that I was after.</p>
                    <p>Just as early advertisements of the TV dinner took advantage of the then-novelty status of television sets, I decided to mess with mobile web browsing because it felt more intimate and invasive than the more ambient experience of reading on desktop. Early sketches of the site saw me drawing literal visual metaphors of the average TV dinner, from the structure of stacked boxes in the freezer to the gesture of cutting and poking holes in the tray’s plastic film.</p>
                    <br>
                    <div style="display: grid;grid-template-columns: 31% 3% 31% 3% 31%;">

                    </div><br>
                    <p>This approach soon fell flat, as I was still relying on relatively default expectations of how reading on mobile ought to be. Instead of dragging a finger across the screen, what if I treated the phone as a tray, with the website’s text sliding around like chunks of food as the reader tilts their screen?</p>
                    <div style="padding:72.97% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/728343966?h=ba08d64c9d&amp;loop=1&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="Fresh Not Frozen (testing)"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>
                    <span class="caption">[VD] Two clips: intermediate testing of initial iterations of the site on mobile phones, with especial attention to the speed of trailing text.</span>
                    <p>After narrowing my focus to just the phone’s orientation in space, I started playing around with the text’s viscosity. My refined direction also meant that with an unfamiliar way of navigating the website, I had to understand how people intuitively interact with touchscreens. Because I broke up the narrative into Now This-styled short chunks of excerpts and quotes, it was important that the interface be friendly enough for readers to learn on the go. Offering enough affordances and cues while avoiding condescending instructions became a top priority.</p>
                    <p>The result of this is a microsite that responds to data from the phone’s gyroscope, set to saturated colors referencing freezing technology ads from the sixties. As an exploration into the potential of disrupting familiar reading experiences, Fresh Not Frozen leans into the subdued frenzy of jumping across mobile applications and invites readers to dedicate some time to honoring this rather mundane consumer good.</p>
                    <p>As a topic I plan to push further, future iterations of Fresh Not Frozen could include more auditory guides and higher contrast colors adjusted for accessibility. Additional considerations for copywriting in the event that the visitor’s screen orientation is locked could also be helpful.</p>

                    <p>Some texts on the iPhone (STOTI) is a collection of writings about Apple’s particular brand of luxury fast fashion mobile phones. As an experiment in transposing digital fabrication techniques to an otherwise more analogue, two-dimensional editorial design process, this book posits several questions about the iPhone’s role in contemporary American society as a status symbol that is so often smashed, dropped down fifty-storey buildings, and submerged in liquid nitrogen.</p>
                    <p>Made of clear acrylic sheets, the book mimics the materiality of an iPhone screen, with laser-engraved text and imagery on the undersides to emulate the phone’s compelling touch interactions that are so visceral yet intangible, confined to the flatness of the screen. Interspersed with screenshots of iPhone-wrecking YouTube videos abstracted beyond immediate recognition, the book also considers the iPhone’s creative destruction in a more romantic light.</p>
                    <p>STOTI comes loose leaf, with a bolt, washer, and nut for simple assembly.</p>

                    <p>Inspired by Moniker’s <em><a href="https://studiomoniker.com/projects/your-line-or-mine">Your Line or Mine</a></em> and Clement Valla’s <em><a href="http://clementvalla.com/work/mechanical-turk-alphabet/">Mechanical Turk Alphabets</a></em>, <a href="https://www.beszi.work/">Betsy Ellison</a> and I designed a set of three posters promoting a ouija board seance hosted by the St. Louis Paranormal Research Society.</p>
                    <img src="2025/projects-media/situated.png" alt="some people walking past a brick building, upon which are mounted three posters."><br>
                    <img src="marking.png" alt="two people drawing on some posters with a permanent marker. the posters are taped to a brick wall.">
                    <p>Each of the three posters is integral to the legibility of the message as a whole, with the sole instruction, “Roll the die and mark out the symbol you receive, as many times as you desire. A hidden message will appear.”
                    <p>Playing with the gesture of obscuring and revealing information, the posters mix clairvoyance with the occult, taking form through the participation of curious passerby.</p>
                    <img src="testing.png" alt="the shadow of someone making small marks on a semi-opaque poster, taped to a glass wall. in the background are some buildings and a green lawn, with a blue sky.">
                    <p>Starting off as a blank slate, the set plays with the illusion of endless possibility in its densely textured grid of seemingly random symbols. With each letter consisting of several individually “chosen” marks, event info emerges as the result of strangers’ collaboration over the span of a day.</p>
                    <img src="trials.png" alt="three posters, side by side, all with the text 'OUIJA BOARD SEANCE — OCT 30 — 9PM — LEMP BREWERY OFFICE' placed throughout. some posters contain dots for visitors to connect, others with grids of cells to fill out.">
                    <p>As “crowdsourced” posters, the success of this set relied on several rounds of testing with our classmates. We had to keep in mind different variables: how complete should the message be? What writing instruments would each mark require, and at what scale? Other questions we considered ranged from the markmaking surface, (ultimately mylar paper for its on-theme opaqueness) to the making of our dice (woodburned 2" blocks).</p>

                    <p>Drawing from my interests in aesthetics and online culture, Basic Space is a small fictional festival exploring the design of meme formats to ask, <em>how do information and content relate to their container? Diagrammatic things carry a natural importance and legitimacy — what happens when we empty memes, media that often is already so distilled to its most essential ideas?</em></p>
                    <p>This project emerged from an exercise to program a generative pattern maker. Pulling from four popular meme formats — the political compass, Advice Animals, Is This A Pigeon, and Loss — I began with a dense, quiltlike texture, which ultimately makes up the background of the event’s posters.</p>
                    <p>The festival’s promotional materials come with a microsite prototyped in p5.js. As a metaphor for the anatomy of memes, mouse interactions reveal the outlines of the festival’s name — the bubbling circle changing color as the visitor hovers over the four quadrants, referencing the political compass. By using widely available typefaces, these assets emphasize the content-driven nature of memes as a communicative medium.</p>

                    <p>Nostalgia Loop is a newspaper containing two essays about the role of nostalgia in American and global politics. Pulling from the visual language of vintage kids food graphics, the design of the broadsheet seeks to establish a sense of comfort and outmoded longing for a past so familiar in television commercials. However, as the reader progresses, the orderly two-column layout is interrupted by an enclosed poster that asks, how complacent are we willing to be, steeped in this nostalgia?</p>
                    <p>With a front cover referencing the densely packed layout of celebrity tabloids and subheadings set in an austere and narrow serif, the newspaper strives to evoke my personal ambivalence towards this tendency to romanticize the past.</p>

With melting, machine learning-generated wojaks[1] from Nathan and my code for typesetting randomly-chosen fonts in layouts that range from a single image macro[2] to a 3×3 pseudo-alignment chart,[3] our final sampler serendipitously reveals a potential beauty in such inky, uncanny compositions.</p>

                    <p>Jussi Parikka’s essay, <a href="https://malware.hetnieuweinstituut.nl/en/malware-operational-art-ifthen-geopolitics-and-tricksters">“Malware as Operational Art: On the If/Then of Geopolitics and Tricksters,”</a> encourages a reconsideration of glitches and instances of computer failure as the norm.</p>
                    <p>Continuing my research into interface metaphors, the structure of this book references the skeletal syntax of the web and the layered, nested anatomy of HTML. Smaller moves — the unravelling typography and cut paper revealing a computer-generated texture on the inner folds — seek to reinforce this theme of perceived danger, offering an uneasy, anti-reader friendly experience.</p>
                    <p>The use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_(sans-serif_typeface)">San Francisco</a> references the visual language of Apple products, whereas <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Apple_typefaces#Script_and_handwritten">Apple Chancery</a> embodies the sprawl of weeds and hints at contagion. A condensed <a href="https://authentic.website/sans.html">Authentic Sans</a> invites the reader to reconsider what a book can be — as seen in the front cover, which seeks to act as a billboard.</p>

                <p>A digital zen garden: collecting worldwide memories submitted anonymously on the little memory app; exploring ASCII art and the metaphor of memories as blossoming flowers.</p>

                    <p>memory garden (memgarden) began as wireframes for a speculative online memory archive comprising anonymous memories submitted to <a href="https://new.thelittlememory.com/">the little memory</a>, a mobile journaling app. I was initially interested in the metaphors of language as furniture and memories as flowers, as well as the potential of curating a private and meditative space for people watching and personal reflection.</p>

                    <p>Later adapting these sketches as a small p5.js-based prototype, I leaned further into ASCII art influences, having been introduced to the wondrous worlds of digital gardening and the handmade web.</p>

                    <p>A Window For Two (AWFT) is a program that explores the poetics of screenshots. With an origin story involving LinkedIn’s auto-suggested one-word replies, AWFT grew to more precisely offer a moment of mutual appreciation between the visitor and their machine. The drawn-out windows play with the interface metaphor of the window as both a container of a view and a discrete scene on a computer display.</p>
