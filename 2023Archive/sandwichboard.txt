I'm interested in thinking of/using this website as a sandwichboard:

    1. the two-sided, hinged structure of a sandwichboard makes the person wearing it part of the advertisement. inexplicably this reflects my general attitude towards personal branding/self aware self promotion in graphic design.

    2. the format loosely reminds me of books, and how we might translate a reading experience in print to the web. it also feels like HTML (with its matching tags).

    3. i think there's a way to use the vernacular of advertising to both accomplish the primary purpose of this website as my portfolio, but also keep it personal (the personal/professional divide is what i struggle with here)

    4. i feel there's some expressive potential in terms of responsiveness if we take this sandwichboard metaphor to the extreme
