        <p> Investigating the role mealtime videos choreograph expectations around dining, 
            UGTVWMWZ (short for <em>UGTVWMWZ  2-Piece Silverware Flatware Set, Silicone Dishware Safe (City Chic) Adult Diet Tableware, Includes 1 Fork 1 Plate, Modular Configurable for Mealtime Relaxation, Destress Set for Teens Adults Halloween Christmas Gift)</em> 
            is a tray with embedded screens (roughly demonstrated above) that maximizes 
            media absorption. Instead of assigning mealtime videos any moral judgment, 
            the tray seeks to fuse media and dietary absorption, such that eating and interacting 
            with food is situated as a means to an end — near-constant immersion into frenetic, 
            serialized, always-on media. In this clip, the user launches pieces of food at 
            respective compartments to scroll through media.
