The images on the clock are drawn in a style mimicking medieval European manuscript illustration and are drawn in white against a black background. The clock is fixed to the back of a desktop monitor.">
        <p>A small status clock involving a microservo and a remix of my ever-stalled adaptation of Phoebe Anna Traquair’s <a href="https://liuleslie.github.io/phoebe/">writing hand</a>.</p>
        <p>The precedent for this was Isaac Blankensmith & Smooth Technology & co’s <a href="https://isaacblankensmith.com/Paper-Signals-A-kit-to-make-your-own-paper-display-that-tracks-useful">Paper Signals</a> for Experiments with Google. I wanted to make something that likewise would be materially useful, and settled on this clock inspired by that of the metal status boards in some School of Art faculty/staff's offices in the basements on campus — as well as the Weasley family clock, from my Potterhead days long ago.</p>
        <p>This project really humbled me — this was the first time I had to scramble and concretely think through how I’d be attaching things — though I achieved it (so jankily...). I also overthought the code; the process would’ve been much smoother if I’d understood more clearly how the servo updated its position between runs.</p>
        <p>I’d like to make some laser cut, refined version of this sometime in the future.</p>

        <p>(Such an incredibly janky setup)</p>
