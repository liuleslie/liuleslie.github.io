        <p>A shape grammar I developed from this thread about the relationship between writing and drawing. With absurd beginnings from a clip of <em>Nathan For You</em> with the caricature artist, I was taken by the way east Asian scripts are generally represented by those who aren’t familiar with it: see wonton fonts and yellow peril propaganda.</p>

        <p>I adapted it as a shakily composed entry for <a href="https://radicalcharacters.org/radical-return">Radical Characters’ <em>Radical Return</em></a>. There was something in it about this question of <em><a href="https://www.are.na/block/13087100">how can I take advantage of my ignorance?</a></em></p>
        <p>With influences from asemic writing and botched tattoos of Chinese text, I suppose I am trying to ask, <em>What does it mean when a script, a hand, a calligraphic style becomes adornment for Latin letterforms, positioned as a signifier of some sort of exoticism, edginess, or allure?</em></p>
