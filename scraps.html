                    <p>Deep fried aesthetics take on an absurdist, bleak tone. I want to analyze deeptok & heavily edited media to understand how and why we (≈gen z) gravitate to noise. Drawing on Andy Warhol’s silkscreens of Marilyn Monroe and the Tuna Disaster as an example of this. </p>
                    <p>Glitch aesthetics are tech friendly—they embrace errors and bugs—Zalgo’s sprawling, almost bacterial structure is post-human. It reminds me of fraktur and black ink tattoos (grindesign for instance) in its vertical, long & piercing letterforms. (+ suffixing & prefixing via “vertical building” to evoke the appearance of a digital virus)</p>
                    <p>Meme depreciation doesn’t necessarily correlate to distilled meaning. Often the more warped the content is, the greater the absurdity and so the deeper the relatability (though it does follow the uncanny valley graph, sort of, since reactions to the deeper parts of deeptok are usually something like “this is scary but I feel safe here”).</p>
                    <p>Focusing on two types of noise: one feeds into the culture of annoyance and being mentally tired, the other something more monstrous, something more apocalyptic. The former embodied in Instagram comedy & bigger Youtube channels, where people take successful Vine formulas and stretch them out to a minute—fast paced clips, screaming, dead horse tropes/worn out stereotypes, hypersexualized imagery, threats of violence, a lot of cheating—and presumably packaged for an older audience though these accounts’ followers often skew younger (around twelve to early teens). All this noise feels like a highway system where billboards/pop ups advertise extreme experiences (when extrapolated, they revolve around money, sex and being online).</p>
                    <p>The second sort of noise is the pull of the unknown, the fascination with the macabre and the extraterrestrial. (banana rotate by Mirabeau Studios & on Tumblr & another Jojo themed version) Through this distinctive visual/editing style people look to feedcrafting as a way to construct and define their personality: the perceived division between “straight tik tok” and “alt tik tok,” the countless -tok subcommunities as well as the “my friend: ‘did you see Charli’s new dance?’ my fyp: ” all point to an unexplainable resonance with deep fried visuals.</p>
