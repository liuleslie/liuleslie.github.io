The images on the clock are drawn in a style mimicking medieval European manuscript illustration and are drawn in white against a black background. The clock is fixed to the back of a desktop monitor.">
                <p>A small status clock involving a microservo and a remix of my ever-stalled adaptation of Phoebe Anna Traquair’s <a href="https://liuleslie.github.io/phoebe/">writing hand</a>.</p>
                <p>The precedent for this was Isaac Blankensmith & Smooth Technology & co’s <a href="https://isaacblankensmith.com/Paper-Signals-A-kit-to-make-your-own-paper-display-that-tracks-useful">Paper Signals</a> for Experiments with Google. I wanted to make something that likewise would be materially useful, and settled on this clock inspired by that of the metal status boards in some School of Art faculty/staff's offices in the basements on campus — as well as the Weasley family clock, from my Potterhead days long ago.</p>
                <p>This project really humbled me — this was the first time I had to scramble and concretely think through how I’d be attaching things — though I achieved it (so jankily...). I also overthought the code; the process would’ve been much smoother if I’d understood more clearly how the servo updated its position between runs.</p>
                <p>I’d like to make some laser cut, refined version of this sometime in the future.</p>

                    A reflection on how the data I produce flows through my local internet of things: 
                    particularly interested in the materiality of the internet (specifically, my router data), 
                    I found a 2021 <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/look-what-isps-know-about-you-examining-privacy-practices-six-major-internet-service-providers/p195402_isp_6b_staff_report.pdf">Federal Trade Commission report</a> 
                    examining how six major internet service providers (mine included) “amass large pools 
                    of sensitive data, and that their uses of such data could lead to significant harms, 
                    particularly when consumers are classified by demographic characteristics.”

                <summary>Asemic shape grammar</summary>
                <p>Fall 2024.</p>
                <img src="https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/32393143/original_e50165e521d9d90bfb3fdf65320d059e.png?1732150670?bc=0" alt="Black text on white background of a flowchart diagram specifying the combination of a set of calligraphic strokes.">
                <p>A shape grammar I developed from this thread about the relationship between writing and drawing. With absurd beginnings from a clip of <em>Nathan For You</em> with the caricature artist, I was taken by the way east Asian scripts are generally represented by those who aren’t familiar with it: see wonton fonts and yellow peril propaganda.</p>
                <p>I adapted it as a shakily composed entry for <a href="https://radicalcharacters.org/radical-return">Radical Characters’ <em>Radical Return</em></a>. There was something in it about this question of <em><a href="https://www.are.na/block/13087100">how can I take advantage of my ignorance?</a></em></p>
                <p>With influences from asemic writing and botched tattoos of Chinese text, I suppose I am trying to ask, <em>What does it mean when a script, a hand, a calligraphic style becomes adornment for Latin letterforms, positioned as a signifier of some sort of exoticism, edginess, or allure?</em></p>
