          <p>Computer Grass is Natural Grass (CGING) is a poster/website that delves into interface metaphors and theories of human-computer interaction. This research project/topic began with the question, <em>what counternarratives to mainstream web design/tech development would I like to highlight?</em> Stemming from an interest and personal dedication to a softer, more poetic web/online community, CGING not only serves as a record of my notes on these topics, but also embodies my ever-shifting relationship with technology and contemporary web design.</p>
          <p>The original poster that launched CGING was concerned with applying interface metaphors to a print environment — this took the shape of integrating hyperlinks (portals) and modes of citation that reference the Whole Earth Catalog and medieval manuscripts.</p>

          <p>Since adapting the poster as a website, my stance on digital design has changed. While the poster especially draws from the gorgeous roundedness of macOS’s interfaces, the website has been redesigned to be much more pared back in order to honor the poster’s findings. Maybe it’ll shift again in the future, as much of my journey learning about/being part of communities discussing digital design has shown me how delicate the relationship between aesthetics and their embedded ideologies truly is.</p>
