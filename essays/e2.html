        <hr>

        <p>I’ve been steeping myself in solitude, both out of necessity and out of habit. I’ve been thinking about love, in all its forms — platonic love, cosmic love, self love, romantic love — coming up with ways to describe them has led me to appreciate the importance of metaphors for containers and different ways of holding something in one’s heart.</p>
        <p>Maybe it’s because of my interest in nontraditional representations and unconventional forms of intimacy and care these days that I’ve begun to plant myself more firmly in learning about time, space, and generosity. <span class="noted" id="notedvia-1"><a href="#note-1">[1]</a></span></p>
        <p>I’ve been wondering, what do generous tools feel like, how can flaws and weaknesses be a source of abundance? The slipperiness of memory is a feature, not a bug; optimizing the brain feels like a loveless — hostile, even — chore.</p>
        <p>As I stumble my way through being more loving and forgiving with myself, I’ve come to realize with awe and a little sadness and wistfulness, that the world in its most vibrant form can be so wondrous: the desire to be heard, seen, felt, moved — understood — is a sacred one. <span class="noted" id="notedvia-2"><a href="#note-2">[2]</a></span></p>
        <p>In the instructions for her game <em><a href="https://narratopia.com/aboutnarratopia.html">Narratopia</a></em>, Cynthia F. Kurtz writes,</p>
        <blockquote>When we give someone a gift, the paper we wrap it in is a physical representation of a ritualized message. … we use wrapping paper to signal a context of noncritical acceptance. Stories work in the same way… When we tell each other stories, we give each other gifts that draw us together, help us keep learning, and make life fun.</blockquote>

        <p>What can be a gift, a present? <span class="noted" id="notedvia-4"><a href="#note-4">[4]</a></span></p>
        <p>How can our personal approaches to tools be a gift to others who are looking for ways to exist against the ruthless pace of tech-enabled hyperconsumption?</p>
        <p>(If questions are an interface to connection, how might we ask questions that serve as gift wrapping paper?)</p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>It is important to honor unformed questions, sprawling ideas: even though they may appear like weeds — not as manageable as a flower — they lay the foundations for thought. <span class="noted" id="notedvia-5"><a href="#note-5">[5]</a></span></p>
        <p>While this exercise may not be very tangible, I hope you can imagine it and rewrite it as you see fit.</p>

        <p>A working guide to asking questions <span class="noted" id="notedvia-6"><a href="#note-6">[6]</a></span></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Decide on the texture of your question. What kind of question would you like this to be? Is it something picked up from someone and passed down, destined for regifting? Or might it be more delicate and private? For instance, it might be as simple as “why am I drawn to certain things?” or “am I using my words the way I’d like to?”</li>
            <li>Try answering the question, and see where it leads you — embrace a series of “why”s — you’ll figure out what you’re wrapping as you ask your question; its shape will emerge. Sometimes you may go a few steps too deep as you nest the following questions; perhaps go back and forth between the layers, and settle with one that feels true and still challenging.</li>
            <li>Once you feel at home with this question, keep it in a pocket and carry it around with you. Switch out, add more as needed. </li>
        </ol>
