        <p>The social web sometimes feels like a fridge, or an empty superstore. Flickering, fluorescent, and interstitial, it’s grown boggy, weighed down by the acidity of advertising and relentless monetization. It’s a tired refrain: that social media is a wasteland, that there must be other spaces that can truly work <em>with</em> and for us. We repeat this, with varying degrees of believability and conviction. Trudging through the digital litter scattered about by get-rich-quick schemes, we wonder if this is it. <em>Is this all that we amount to?</em></p>
        <p>The rosy vision of the web I hang on to — one that’s akin to a fresh world in video games — persists in pockets of the internet here and there. But it feels falsely nostalgic because I wasn’t around when the famed Web 1.0 was at its peak, and the distance created by that fantasy can feel dangerous. So instead I look for people with that same yearning within the bureaucratic spaces afforded by social media platforms, where the environment prescribes a perpetually upbeat tone. I find them in the margins: Youtube livestream chats, on Soundcloud, scattered about comment sections of music videos, generously sharing moments from their lives to a simultaneously ubiquitous and empty audience.</p>
        <p>It’s through this patchy, makeshift process of searching through the margins that I’ve come to feel reliably at ease on the internet. But how can you gather a home online when the act of portalling among myriad browser tabs acclimates you to fragmentation and disorientation? Perhaps a stable home online doesn’t necessarily require you to nest anywhere permanently; there might be rituals and familiar gestures that we can instead call upon for a sense of belonging.</p>
        <p>Around 100 AD, Plutarch remarked on the apparent foolishness of the Roman graffiti he came across: “only so-and-so ‘remembers’ so-and-so, and ‘wishes him the best,’ and is ‘the best of his friends,’ and many things full of such ridiculousness.”<sup id="notedvia-1"><a href="#note-1">1</a></sup> Perhaps our contemporary equivalents to Roman graffiti are online scribbles in comment sections and livestreams; perhaps this type of mark-making has always been maligned. Today, it doesn’t feel ‘ridiculous,’ as Plutarch would have it, but insistent and necessary — there’s a hunger for connection. Maybe a better analogy for these online margins are public bathroom stalls and desks, where people make their marks to simply say, “I was here.” Inscribing a confession on the built environment — even a digital one — strikes me as a small, minute gesture towards immortalizing one’s memory.</p>
        <p>In his book about the way marginal imagery in manuscripts reveals the social mores of medieval society, Michael Camille argues that “the center is... dependent upon the margins for its continued existence.” As two poles of the same spectrum, the encounter between the official text and the margins was often a site for the manuscript illuminators’ commentary. From monstrous beasts springing forth, leering at the reader, to people engaged in various bizarre and suggestive acts, the margins offered a space for unfiltered expression of all human instincts. However, no matter how absurd the illustration, their “inscription within the <em>status quo</em> [i.e., being secondary to the main text]... prevents [them] from becoming subversive... it is ‘at once against the law and on the side of the law’.”<sup id="notedvia-2"><a href="#note-2">2</a></sup> Likewise, Instagram offers us 1080-pixel blocks for personal expression, with a comment section tacked on at the bottom like a gallery bench. Scrolling through the feed is like speedrunning the art museum.<sup id="notedvia-3"><a href="#note-3">3</a></sup> How comfortable is this experience, really? Are we truly felt and understood?</p>
        <p>I believe that the margins of the social web harbor great potential for a different kind of encounter. Bathroom wall graffiti is unique for its potential to build community asynchronously in an otherwise banal space. While we may argue that social media platforms were built with good intentions, we are nonetheless all too familiar with their negative impact. While it may help to decry the internet as an inevitable hellscape of contemporary life, what does indulging in our self-sabotage really do for us? Much like public bathroom stalls, there is a particular quality to the internet that makes it an accessible space for personal confession, and there may be lowered expectations in a not-so-glamorous environment. If we honor the feelings that emerge from the margins, we might be able to work against the impulses that social media giants work to ingrain in us.</p>
