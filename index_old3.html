Instead of assigning mealtime videos any moral judgment, the tray seeks to fuse media and dietary absorption, such that eating and interacting with food is situated as a means to an end — near-constant immersion into frenetic, serialized, always-on media. In this clip, the user launches pieces of food at respective compartments to scroll through media.</p>

                    A reflection on how the data I produce flows through my local internet of things: 
                    particularly interested in the materiality of the internet (specifically, my router data), 
                    I found a 2021 <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/look-what-isps-know-about-you-examining-privacy-practices-six-major-internet-service-providers/p195402_isp_6b_staff_report.pdf">Federal Trade Commission report</a> 
                    examining how six major internet service providers (mine included) “amass large pools 
                    of sensitive data, and that their uses of such data could lead to significant harms, 
                    particularly when consumers are classified by demographic characteristics.”

                    Expressing your inner self is sometimes confusing or might not fit certain preconceptions, so I really root for people to do it. 
                    Maybe that’s the extrovert in me talking — it might be a very daunting thought for people who are not comfortable with it. 
                    But <span class="highlight">I just desperately want to understand what your position is.</span> 
                    To me that has a lot to do with being honest.

                <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colophon_(publishing)#History">Rewritten, thank God.</a> This is self-contained HTML set in <a href="http://osp.kitchen/foundry/fluxisch-else/">Fluxisch Else</a>.</p>

                    <summary>Why and how, ”self-contained?”</summary>
                    <p>There has always been something charming about a self-contained website to me. 
                        This desire for the potential of expression made compact, travel-size, extends to other things: 
                        sketchbooks, pockets, forms and multipurpose containers of information and thought.
                    </p>
                    <p>The infinite recomposability of a single HTML file is exciting to me: as I tab through 
                        different past site-selves there is something resonant in the ways I am trying 
                        to embody something more abstract, something aspirational: if my skeleton could be brutalist, 
                        exacting somehow... and there is the tireless rewriting of a self, of this presence, 
                        through the familiar tags and syntax, the usual sleight of hand by shoving things into 
                        &lt;details&gt;.
