    <p><em>Washington University Political Review</em> (WUPR) is a student-run political publication at WashU covering domestic and international news, with each issue revolving around a central theme. As a design lead at WUPR, I largely focused on creating illustrations to accompany articles, as well as the occasional cover.</p>
