          <p><a href="https://remake.wustl.edu/"><em>REMAKE</em></a> is an annual journal published by the Washington University in St. Louis College Writing Program celebrating first-year work. Having collaborated with the editors in 2020 on the inaugural issue, I was able to sharpen the journal’s design system in 2021, implementing both a grid and color palette that accommodate for and indicate different types of submissions.</p>
          <p>In order to highlight the vibrant community of young creators and serve the journal’s goal to change the top-down hierarchy of creative and academic content, we structured the publication so that student work would appear first, supplemented by interviews with local artists and writers towards the end.</p>
