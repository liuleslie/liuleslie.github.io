                    <p>
                        I’ll get to this, surely — but a quick explainer is that I consider this website a sandwichboard. 
                        The sandwichboard is an important metaphor for me: it is something that can be not only 
                        standalone but also worn and traveled. The sandwichboard is like a T-shirt as a billboard. 
                        (And how potent other media, wares are: yard signs, bumper stickers, hats.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In past iterations of this website, I’ve struggled to delineate what is cleanly “work” v. “play”; 
                        I’d wanted to be able to categorize things neatly — how lovely to be able to point to something and 
                        declare, “that is me!”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I’ve since let go of this sort of thinking and embraced this tension where I am both fascinated by and 
                        frustrated with advertising. From <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C1AKXAyu1us/">Yedoye on Subway Takes</a>: 
                        <span class="quote">“Society went down a very dark path by making commercials funny. ... Because we’ve blurred the lines between what’s real and what’s not. 
                        We are now clamoring for the right to be marketed to. That is our idea of liberation.”</span> 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a bright-eyed design student I used to exclaim “we really just wanna be artists... but don’t wanna take up the 
                        mantle of what ‘art’ entails or the responsibility that comes with it...” — that advertising is graphic design’s 
                        way of making art within the society and economic imaginaries we live in.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a computational design student now (I think for me this label really only means that I am actively trying to engage more computer) 
                        the sandwichboard is a reminder of how we construct meaning from the environments in which we encounter resonant media. 
                        Advertising, then, is a medium through which to think through the ways we’ve been told to desire, express, navigate the world. 
                        I wouldn’t describe what I’m doing as necessarily trying to resist the at times sycophantic impulses of advertising — and by extension, 
                        technologies — but rather I hope to make “stuff” that people find useful (for conversation and reflection), entertaining, or ideally — both.

Instead of assigning mealtime videos any moral judgment, the tray seeks to fuse media and dietary absorption, such that eating and interacting with food is situated as a means to an end — near-constant immersion into frenetic, serialized, always-on media. In this clip, the user launches pieces of food at respective compartments to scroll through media.</p>

                    <p>
                        A reflection on how the data I produce flows through my local internet of things: 
                        particularly interested in the materiality of the internet (specifically, my router data), 
                        I found a 2021 <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/look-what-isps-know-about-you-examining-privacy-practices-six-major-internet-service-providers/p195402_isp_6b_staff_report.pdf">Federal Trade Commission report</a> 
                        examining how six major internet service providers (mine included) “amass large pools 
                        of sensitive data, and that their uses of such data could lead to significant harms, 
                        particularly when consumers are classified by demographic characteristics.”

                        I really want everyone to be themselves as much as they can, all the time. I want that from everyone because, in my mind, like you say, that's the interesting part of the person. Expressing your inner self is sometimes confusing or might not fit certain preconceptions, so I really root for people to do it. Maybe that’s the extrovert in me talking — it might be a very daunting thought for people who are not comfortable with it. But I just desperately want to understand what your position is. To me that has a lot to do with being honest.

                        At the heart of all this motion is a lust for crawling through someone else’s ambiguity, in staring at a post or profile for longer than the machine’s trained you to, in the toothsome frustration of trying to figure out what’s a revelation, what’s a dark joke, and what’s just the result of a chemically imbalanced brain and an eternally available keyboard.

                        <p>Naming is control. It establishes, if not ownership, at least a relationship of some intimacy as well as a chain of bizarre equivalences: a set of wiggles in the muscles of the mouth and larynx = a set of phonemes = a constellation of letters = a star. It’s a pretty arbitrary chain, but it’s all that allows us to talk about the world. But what does it mean to name something that cannot hear you, in a world that doesn’t care?</p>

                        As a child of the 20th century I have often wondered why people turned to posting their personal memorabilia online in the first place—as opposed to keeping their artifacts to themselves, to be shared selectively and in person. It seems to me that the moment one embraces an Internet-enabled technology as a medium for sharing one’s lived experience, one is implicitly relinquishing control over those experiences.

                        This is the most important design issue today: that design is <em>always</em> imbued with a political rinse — it is not a pure medium, and it does not exist in a vacuum; design is always situated in a grander play of power.

                        But she is a useful caution about the dangers of substituting positions for feelings and opinions and mistaking what’s important to you for what’s important, period. Ending up homeless because you’re holding on to your teenage&nbsp;resentments&nbsp;doesn’t mean you know anything important about poverty. Giving up work you might enjoy and be good at defeats no interests other than your own. And you won’t be able to change the world if you’re too perpetually affronted to actually live in it.

                        An elite is not necessarily an exploitative formation, but simply a closed group of people who determines their own criteria of inclusion. Design education, even when it is blatantly anti-capitalist, horizontal and the like, is doing exactly that: determining the criteria of inclusion within its cultural circle.

                        Workers themselves know better than anyone else what’s right for them and what needs to change about their conditions. More people just need to listen to them, to have some damn empathy for each other.

                        That idea of dealing with a world that is gray with a mind that tries to see in black and white, of trying to push the square shaped peg into the round hole, is so integral to understanding our struggles not just as people on the spectrum, but as humans. When your life is filtered through media, it’s difficult to accept a reality where you don’t always ride off into the sunset. This is what it means to be on the spectrum.

                        I’m curious now, though, about a word Carson uses—<em>concern</em>—which implies a fear of loss, and instilling that fear, a care for the self I didn’t have when we met. For I was never afraid of dissolution by desire, not the way the ancient Greeks put it—I wonder if they weren’t truly afraid of Eros, but if describing it with violence was simply a way of honoring its power, the same way they venerated their other gods. But I don’t know what comes after, once I decide to let desire have its way with me.

                        But I think that reading that ends in an emotion is lame; I like it more when literature generates not a distinct emotion or feeling but a more generalized overall mood, and I like this more because I think it’s more reflective of the way we actually spend most of our lives.

                        in school it was obvious that design was about balancing order and chaos (see: adages like making and breaking the grid, learning the rules so you can break them, etc).

                    Expressing your inner self is sometimes confusing or might not fit certain preconceptions, so I really root for people to do it. 
                    Maybe that’s the extrovert in me talking — it might be a very daunting thought for people who are not comfortable with it. 
                    But <span class="highlight">I just desperately want to understand what your position is.</span> 
                    To me that has a lot to do with being honest.

                        This desire for the potential of expression made compact, travel-size, extends to other things: 
                        sketchbooks, pockets, forms and multipurpose containers of information and thought.

                        different past site-selves there is something resonant in the ways I am trying 
                        to embody something more abstract, something aspirational: if my skeleton could be brutalist, 
                        exacting somehow... and there is the tireless rewriting of a self, of this presence, 
                        through the familiar tags and syntax, the usual sleight of hand by shoving things into 
                        &lt;details&gt;.
