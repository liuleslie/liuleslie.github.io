        <summary>Aspiring morning person living in New England. Works primarily across print and interaction design, with additional interests in creative technology, user research, exhibition design, and new media. Currently a digital designer at <a id="soso" href="https://www.sosolimited.com/">Sosolimited</a>. Resume available upon request.</summary>
        <p>
          I am interested in experiences that are magical, stuff that helps us reconsider intimacy and connection, as well as overlooked or ignored spaces online, in books, and beyond. Dedicated to silly and serious things.
        </p>
        <p>I enjoy making friendly and generative tools, books, and programs and wading the handmade web. Recent topics that are important to me include mass/pop aesthetics, cringe and embarrassment online, and media both harsh and soft. I would like to become part of the background; always down for a chat or to collaborate.
