                            a few days ago i was writing an email to someone; it feels like this is a season to be especially — 
            whats the word? like, i guess to just practice my penmanship. and it was interesting, you know, because 
            i was recording an audio message and i was using my phone to do this and playing it back they had this 
            skip silence option, which was interesting, because like — one thing i love about conversation is the 
            sound of voices, how people intonate, their mannerisms which is interesting to observe. and a big part 
            of this is gesture, right? there's so much thats so personal when it comes to talking to people .and you 
            see the different gestures and mannerisms evolve over different mediums. but yeah. i was kind of confused, 
            right, about this skip silence button, because i feel that - its utilitarian features aside / even though 
            i put videos on 2x speed and my parents make fun of me for doing that — the pace of life these days is 
            so fast, i want to sit with silence a bit more, and im realizing as i do this im letting my attention 
            get fractured, and [im] not being fully present with my words... but its fun to me to distribute my mind's 
            workload into these different things where im perceiving gaps in speech, but also seeing when the audio 
            is taking up space again. not really sure how to use this sentiment tracker, which is mostly for how high 
            energy and positive you are, so if i go up with my cursor, this is more high energy and positive, but 
            if the thing im thinking about is draining and intense, i'll move my cursor down... im interested in 
            making more of these sketches that help me simulate what its like to spend time with my computer. even though 
            this is a work computer.</em></p>
