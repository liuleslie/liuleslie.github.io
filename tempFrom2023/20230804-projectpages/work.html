    <p>On Work is a set of four coffee sleeves that wonder about the nature of work. Inspired by Corporate Memphis, tech/onboarding screen illustrations, and the video game Going Under, these coffee sleeves ponder the reality of the industrialization of time and the way work consumes a person’s identity.</p>
    <p>Each sleeve features a question that relates to a quote excerpted from Bob Black’s “The Abolition of Work” and a QR code linking to a low-fidelity prototype of a selfie filter, drawing on workplace coffee culture. (Prototype contains flashing images.)</p>

In the lower right corner is a person's hand holding a coffee.">
