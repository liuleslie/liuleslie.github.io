    If i had 48 hours to get to know you, here&#39;s what I&#39;d do. Maybe we&#39;d meet at month end, maybe Moon will let us cheat an extra day or so.</p>
            <p>If I had 48 hours left to know you, I&#39;d begin with a hug. Start the clock! We&#39;ll walk along sunset river, as ichor soon cools to lilac, as we borrow warmth to coat our words.</p>
            <p>If I had 46 hours left I&#39;d notice your smile, your monochrome dress, the way your eyes linger on me when i am looking at the 45 clouds. I&#39;d count the 44 inches between our shoulder. Soon to be 43, I&#39;ve learned from sun how to slip ever so closer to you my skyline, you my view.</p>
            <p>If we had 40 hours left we&#39;ll be left to wander midnight river and you&#39;d brush your hand against mine. 36 times, one too many times for coincidence. It&#39;d be a dinner party! You, me, you, me, you, me, you, me. Seats chosen for most eloquent conversation to warm you on this summer night. Lit by a rather shy waning loon.</p>
            <p>If we had 32 left I&#39;d ask to kiss you. The next hour we&#39;d talk in tongues. The next hour we&#39;d talk in body. The next hour we&#39;d talk in body.</p>
            <p>At 26 hours to go we&#39;d stall the sun best we can. No rush, only us. Walk slow like someone who can afford to lose time. Because if we pretend enough, maybe time will forget to punch our hours.</p>
            <p>At 14 left in the early hours of new day we&apos;d sit by the riverbank, feet hanging over the water. This view of starry buildings and single streetlight and occasional passing headlight is our slice of cake - to share, eaten with very tiny forks. We blow out the candlelight, wish the sunlight could wait just a bit longer.</p>
            <p>But these summer nights are in a hurry and sun rises early anyways, so the last hour we&apos;d dedicate to goodbyes. Tears and puddles of sunrise fall onto your bed. As i watch you prepare for your day, I smile. You&#39;re so cute in that monochrome dress, you know?</p>
 
            <p>Goodbyes, I have decided, are a beautiful thing. We don&#39;t mark goodbyes for things not notable. With a goodbye and a bow we decide how to finish our adventure book, packaged then signed then stamped then delivered all too soon. I am comforted to know then, that the last 48 hours holds weight. Brine of collected river words, bowl of coalesced tears, beads of condensed moments.
