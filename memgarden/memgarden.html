        <p>memory garden (memgarden) began as wireframes for a speculative online memory archive comprising anonymous memories submitted to <a href="https://new.thelittlememory.com/">the little memory</a>, a mobile journaling app. I was initially interested in the metaphors of language as furniture and memories as flowers, as well as the potential of curating a private and meditative space for people watching and personal reflection.</p>

        <p>Later adapting these sketches as a small p5.js-based prototype, I leaned further into ASCII art influences, having been introduced to the wondrous worlds of digital gardening and the handmade web.</p>
